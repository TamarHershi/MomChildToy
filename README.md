    * At least two models that have some sort of relationship to one another
         models: mom, child and a toy
    * At least two controllers that handle actions for the two models
        controllers: mom, child and a toy
    * The basic set of CRUD operations associated with each models
        This requires routes, views, controller methods, etc.
    * Pushed to GitHub

## About Mom Child Toy
The idea behind MomChildToy is to display for each mother her list of children, edit and add one if she needs and also check how many toys each child has. The app also gives an access for the child to see her family details (mother and siblings) and also see her toys list and edit the info when she get a new one or donated one.
